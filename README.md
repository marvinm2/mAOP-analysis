# Molecular AOP Transcriptomic Analysis

This repository contains the code and workflows used in the manuscript "[Molecular Adverse Outcome Pathways: towards the implementation of transcriptomics data in risk assessments]". The goal is to analyze GEO datasets in the context of molecular AOPs using pathway-based approaches.

## Structure
- `notebooks/`: contains Jupyter notebooks for GEO2R data integration and enrichment analysis
- `data/`: lists GEO datasets used; processed data not included due to size/ethics, but can be retrieved
- `results/`: selected outputs and figures used in the manuscript

## GEO Datasets
- GSE90122, GSE124053, GSE116280
Processed via GEO2R: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/geo2r/
